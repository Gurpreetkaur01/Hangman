# Hangman
interactive mobile game built with HTML and JavaScript 


 When you play with two people one picks a word and then the other tries to guess it by making repeated guesses to letters in the word. If the letter is in the word then the player who picked a word reveals all the places where that letter is in the final word. If the letter is not in the word then a body part is added to the hangman.

Normally a hangman is considered to be complete when it has a head, a body, two arms and two legs. When all these parts are added the hangman is 'hung' and the guessing player loses. If the guessing player gets all the letters in the word before the hangman is complete, then they win!

In this section we are going to be designing the player who thinks of a word and the logic behind seeing if they have the right answer. Later we will add a user interface to this and handle the input.
